How to use U-boot on Charge MX6UL
-----------------------------------------------

- Build U-boot for MX6UL :

$ make mrproper

$ make mx6ul_charge_mmc_defconfig
or
$ make mx6ul_charge_nand_defconfig

$ make

This will generate the SPL image called SPL and the u-boot.img.

- Flash the SPL image into the micro SD card:

sudo dd if=SPL of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1k seek=1; sync

- Flash the u-boot.img image into the micro SD card:

sudo dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1k seek=69; sync

- Jumper settings:

SD Boot: 0 0 
eMMC Boot: 0 1

- Connect the USB cable between the EVK and the PC for the console.
(The USB console connector is the one close the push buttons)

- Insert the micro SD card in the board, power it up and U-boot messages should
come up.
